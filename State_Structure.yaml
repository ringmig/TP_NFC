application_modes:
  reception_station:
    registration_mode:
      states:
        - idle: "Waiting for Guest ID input"
        - background_scanning: "Continuous tag detection for info display"  
        - writing_tag: "10s operation, blocks all transitions"
      transitions:
        - to_checkpoint_mode: "Switch to Check-in Mode button"
        - to_settings: "Settings button (blocked during write operation)"
        - to_other_stations: "Station buttons (blocked during write operation)"
      
    checkpoint_mode:
      states:
        - scanning: "Continuous background scanning for check-ins"
        - processing: "Processing detected tag check-in"
      transitions:
        - to_registration_mode: "Switch to Registration Mode button"
        - to_settings: "Settings button (allowed)"
        - to_other_stations: "Station buttons (allowed)"

  other_stations:
    checkpoint_only:
      states:

        - between_stations: "Other station buttons (allowed)"

overlay_modes:
  settings_panel:
    states:
      - menu_idle: "Settings menu displayed"
      - tag_info_operation: "10s tag read for info display"
      - erase_operation: "10s tag read for erase confirmation"
    transitions:
      - to_rewrite_mode: "Rewrite Tag button"
      - return_to_previous: "Close settings - returns to exact previous state"
    restrictions:
      - blocks_station_changes: "During active operations only"
      
  rewrite_mode:
    states:
      - idle: "Waiting for Guest ID entry"
      - background_scanning: "Helpful tag detection with status messages"
      - checking_registration: "5s operation to verify tag status"
      - confirmation_dialog: "User confirmation for overwrite"
      - writing: "Actual tag write operation"
    transitions:
      - exit_to_reception: "X button returns to Reception registration"
    restrictions:
      - blocks_all_transitions: "Complete isolation during operations"
      - stops_all_background_scanning: "Prevents conflicts"

  tag_info_display:
    states:
      - displaying_info: "Guest information shown"
      - auto_close_countdown: "10s countdown to auto-close"
    transitions:
      - return_to_origin: "Returns to exact state that triggered tag info"
    special_behavior:
      - allows_background_scanning: "Only in checkpoint modes"

threading_patterns:
  scanning_control:
    flags:
      - is_scanning: "Master control for background scanning loops"
      - _scanning_thread_active: "Prevents concurrent NFC read threads"
    
  operation_coordination:  
    flags:
      - operation_in_progress: "Blocks new user-initiated operations"
      - _active_operations: "Counter for background tasks"
    operation_specific_flags:
      - _write_operation_active: "Registration tag writing"
      - _rewrite_operation_active: "Rewrite mode operations"  
      - _rewrite_check_operation_active: "Rewrite pre-check phase"
      - _tag_info_operation_active: "Tag info reading"
      - _erase_operation_active: "Tag erase operations"

  ui_thread_safety:
    patterns:
      - main_thread_scheduling: "self.after() for all UI updates from threads"
      - safe_widget_access: "_safe_configure_*() methods with existence checks"
      - widget_cleanup: "Proper destruction order and reference clearing"
  
state_restoration_logic:
  settings_panel:
    mechanism: "Remember previous station and mode for return"
    variables: "_came_from_settings flag tracking"
    
  tag_info_display:
    mechanism: "Return to triggering state after display/timeout"
    special_case: "Resume checkpoint scanning if came from checkpoint mode"
    
  rewrite_mode:
    mechanism: "Always returns to Reception registration mode"
    cleanup: "Cancel all rewrite-specific operations and flags"

nfc_timing_constraints:
  do_not_modify:
    - scanning_loop_delays: "3-5 second timeouts for responsiveness"
    - operation_timeouts: "10s for user operations, 5s for checks"
    - restart_delays: "100ms-2000ms for error recovery"
  
  rationale:
    - ui_responsiveness: "Short timeouts allow quick mode switches"
    - cancellation_support: "Easy to stop scanning when switching"
    - error_recovery: "Quick restart if NFC reader hangs"
