# CLAUDE.md - Android Development

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with the TP_NFC Android project.

## STRICT OPERATIONAL PROTOCOL:

**BOOTSTRAP SEQUENCE:**
   - First: Read this Android/CLAUDE.md to load Android-specific context
   - Second: Review root CLAUDE.md for overall project context
   - Third: Check current build status and active configurations

**STATE SYNCHRONIZATION:**
   - After Android changes: Update this Android/CLAUDE.md
   - Keep updates concise but complete with current build status

## Current Session Summary (Service Account Migration & Authentication Revolution - July 2025)

### ✅ Completed This Session:

**19. Complete Service Account Migration** (REVOLUTIONARY UPGRADE ✅):
- **OAuth Elimination**: Completely replaced complex OAuth flow with simple Service Account authentication
- **Google Cloud Service Account**: Created `tp-nfc-service-account@lib-nfc.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with spreadsheet access
- **One-File Authentication**: Single JSON service account file replaces credentials.json + token.json + complex OAuth flow
- **Certificate Independence**: No more SHA-1 certificate fingerprint restrictions - works on any device/build
- **No Token Expiration**: Service accounts never expire, eliminating token refresh failures
- **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**: Perfect for automated staff tablet deployment at events
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Same authentication works across all devices without Google Cloud Console updates

**Key Technical Implementation**:
- **GoogleSheetsService Conversion**: Replaced OAuth imports with `google.oauth2.service_account.Credentials`
- **Simplified Authentication**: One-line authentication: `Credentials.from_service_account_file()`  
- **GitHub Secrets Integration**: Added `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` secret with base64-encoded service account
- **Config Migration**: Updated config.json to use `service_account_file` instead of OAuth credentials
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed OAuth-related packages (google-auth-oauthlib, oauth2client, requests-oauthlib)
- **Local Testing Success**: Verified 397 guests loaded successfully with Service Account authentication

### ✅ Previous Session Achievements:

## Immediate Next Steps

### **Priority 1: Resolve Build Issues**
```bash
# 1. Install Python 3.12 for compatibility
./setup_compatible_python.sh

# 2. Build with Python 3.12
./build_with_py312.sh

# 3. Install new APK
cd android_studio_project && ./install_apk.sh full
```

### **Priority 2: Feature Development**
Once building works:
1. Add NFC functionality gradually
2. Integrate Google Sheets API
3. Add full TP_NFC features
4. Test on real hardware

## Development Workflow

### **Android Studio Development:**
1. **Open project**: `android_studio_project/` in Android Studio
2. **Install APK**: Use `install_apk.sh` for testing
3. **Debug**: Use `debug_logs.sh` for real-time logging
4. **Native development**: Modify Java code in `app/src/main/java/`

### **Python Development:**
1. **Modify**: Python code in `src/` or `main*.py`
2. **Build**: Use appropriate `build_*.sh` script
3. **Test**: Install and test new APK
4. **Iterate**: Debug and improve

### **Common Commands:**
```bash
# Install Python 3.12 and buildozer
./setup_compatible_python.sh

# Build full app with Python 3.12
./build_with_py312.sh

# Install test APK
cd android_studio_project && ./install_apk.sh

# Install full APK (after successful build)
cd android_studio_project && ./install_apk.sh full

# View debug logs
cd android_studio_project && ./debug_logs.sh

# Check running apps
$HOME/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep tpnfc
```

## Key Technical Details

### **Application Architecture:**
- **UI Framework**: Kivy 2.3.1 with Material Design principles
- **Theme System**: Dark mode with consistent color constants
- **Layout**: Density-independent pixels (dp) for responsive design
- **State Management**: Centralized scanning mode and workflow states
- **Data Models**: Guest objects with timestamp tracking

### **NFC Workflow Implementation:**
- **Universal Scanning**: Single button controlling all NFC operations
- **Check-In Mode**: Continuous scanning for guest attendance
- **Register Mode**: Multi-step workflow for tag-to-guest mapping
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Prevents conflicting scanning operations
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded button states (Blue→Orange→Green→Red)

### **Build Dependencies:**
- **Python**: 3.12+ (for buildozer compatibility)
- **Kivy**: 2.3.1 (UI framework)
- **Android SDK**: API 31, NDK 25b
- **Architecture**: arm64-v8a (primary), armeabi-v7a (fallback)

### **Permissions Required:**
- `INTERNET` - Google Sheets API
- `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` - Connectivity detection  
- `NFC` - NFC tag reading
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Local data storage
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` - Local data access

## Integration with Main Project

This Android project is part of the larger TP_NFC system:
- **Desktop app**: `../src/gui/app.py` (4200+ lines CustomTkinter)
- **Shared services**: Ported to `src/services/` for Android
- **Data models**: Common between desktop and Android
- **Configuration**: Android-specific in `buildozer*.spec`

The goal is feature parity between desktop and Android versions with appropriate platform adaptations.

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Build Issues:**
1. **Python 3.13 errors**: Use `build_with_py312.sh` instead
2. **ADB not found**: Scripts auto-detect from Android Studio SDK
3. **CMake errors**: Usually resolved by Python 3.12 setup
4. **Missing APK**: Check `bin/` directory after successful build

### **Runtime Issues:**
1. **App won't launch**: Check package name in `install_apk.sh`
2. **Black screen**: Use `debug_logs.sh` to see Python errors
3. **Permission denied**: Ensure Android device has developer options enabled
