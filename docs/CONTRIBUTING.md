# Contributing to TP_NFC

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TP_NFC! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TP_NFC.git
   cd TP_NFC
   ```
3. **Set up development environment**:
   ```bash
   ./install.command  # macOS/Linux
   # or install.bat   # Windows
   ```
4. **Install development dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install flake8 mypy pytest pytest-cov black isort bandit safety
   ```

### Before You Start

- **Check existing issues** - someone might already be working on it
- **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before implementing
- **Read the documentation** in `docs/` to understand the architecture

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or fix/your-bug-description
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest
   
   # Test manually
   python src/main.py
   
   # Test with hardware
   tools/test_nfc.command
   tools/test_sheets.command
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat(nfc): add support for NTAG216 tags"
   ```

5. **Push and create pull request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

**Follow PEP 8**:
```bash
# Format code before committing
black src/
isort src/

# Check for issues
flake8 src/
mypy src/
```

**Naming Conventions**:
- Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `NFCService`)
- Functions/variables: `snake_case` (e.g., `read_tag`)
- Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`)
- Private methods: `_leading_underscore`

### Documentation

**Docstrings for public methods**:
```python
def read_tag(self, timeout: int = 5) -> Optional[NFCTag]:
    """
    Read an NFC tag from the reader.
    
    Args:
        timeout: Maximum time to wait for tag in seconds
        
    Returns:
        NFCTag object if successful, None if no tag detected
        
    Raises:
        NFCError: If reader hardware error occurs
    """
```

**Comments for complex logic**:
```python
# Use exponential backoff for retries to avoid overwhelming the API
wait_time = 2 ** attempt
```

### Error Handling

**Comprehensive exception handling**:
```python
try:
    result = risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Specific error occurred: {e}")
    # Handle gracefully
except Exception as e:
    self.logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    raise  # Re-raise if can't handle
```

**User-friendly error messages**:
```python
# Bad
raise Exception("Error 123")

# Good  
raise NFCError("NFC reader not found. Please check USB connection and drivers.")
```

### Threading

**UI updates only on main thread**:
```python
# From background thread
def background_operation(self):
    result = long_running_task()
    # Schedule UI update on main thread
    self.after(0, self.update_ui, result)
```

**Proper cleanup**:
```python
def start_operation(self):
    self.operation_in_progress = True
    try:
        # Perform operation
        pass
    finally:
        self.operation_in_progress = False
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

**New features must include tests**:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Manual testing procedures for hardware

**Test Structure**:
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from src.services.nfc_service import NFCService

class TestNFCService:
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test fixtures before each test method."""
        self.nfc_service = NFCService()
    
    def test_successful_tag_read(self):
        """Test successful tag reading scenario."""
        with patch('nfcpy.ContactlessFrontend') as mock_clf:
            mock_clf.return_value.connect.return_value = True
            result = self.nfc_service.read_tag()
            assert result is not None
    
    def test_hardware_error_handling(self):
        """Test proper error handling when hardware fails."""
        with patch('nfcpy.ContactlessFrontend') as mock_clf:
            mock_clf.side_effect = Exception("Hardware error")
            result = self.nfc_service.read_tag()
            assert result is None
```
