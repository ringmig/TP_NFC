# TP_NFC Conversation Starter

## Project Context
**Project:** TP_NFC - NFC attendance tracking system with GUI  
**Location:** `/Users/howard/Documents/GitHub/TP_NFC/`  
**Key Files:** To read before attempting to implement improvements
- `src/gui/app.py` - Main GUI application (2800+ lines, CustomTkinter)
- `State_Structure.yaml` - Complete documentation of threading patterns and race conditions
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Overall project status and completed features
- `Improvements.yaml` - Roadmap for fixes (preserve functionality)

## Previous Session Summary

### NFC Connection Monitoring Fix:

**Issue Fixed**: NFC reader disconnection was spamming ERROR logs every 100ms.

### ✅ Completed:
1. **NFC Connection Monitoring**:
   - Added `_nfc_connected`, `_nfc_connection_error_logged`, `_check_nfc_connection_timer` flags
   - Implemented `start_nfc_connection_monitoring()` and `check_nfc_connection()` 
   - Checks connection every 2s (connected) or 5s (disconnected)
   - Shows "NFC reader not connected - please connect reader" in status bar
   - Auto-resumes appropriate scanning mode on reconnection

2. **Updated All Scanning Loops**:
   - Added NFC connection check at start of: `_rewrite_scan_loop()`, `_registration_scan_loop()`, `_checkpoint_scan_loop()`
   - Prevents read attempts when disconnected (stops spam)

3. **Added Connection Guards to Manual Operations**:
   - `write_to_band()`: Shows error if NFC not connected
   - `erase_tag_settings()`: ✅ Added NFC connection check 
   - `tag_info()`: ✅ Added NFC connection check
   - `rewrite_tag()`: Added NFC connection check

### ❌ CRITICAL - INCOMPLETE:
1. **Missing `rewrite_to_band()` method** - UI calls this but method doesn't exist!
2. **Missing methods referenced in code**:
   - `cancel_any_rewrite_operations()` - called in station switching
   - `exit_rewrite_mode()` - exists but may need review

### Next Steps:
1. Add missing `rewrite_to_band()` method (copy pattern from `write_to_band()`)
2. Complete NFC checks in `erase_tag_settings()` and `tag_info()`
3. Continue with Improvements.yaml Priority 2-4

### Code Modified:
- `src/gui/app.py`: Added NFC monitoring, updated scanning loops (partial)

## Current Session Summary

### ✅ Completed - NFC Connection Guards:

**Issue**: Tag Info and Erase Tag buttons showed generic "No tag detected" message when no NFC reader connected, unlike Rewrite Tag button which showed proper connection error.

**Fixed**: Added NFC connection checks to:
1. `tag_info()` method - Now shows "NFC reader not connected - please connect reader" 
2. `erase_tag_settings()` method - Now shows same user-friendly message

**Result**: All three manual operation buttons (Tag Info, Rewrite Tag, Erase Tag) now consistently show the same helpful message when NFC reader is disconnected.
