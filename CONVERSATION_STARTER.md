# TP_NFC Conversation Starter

## Project Context
**Project:** TP_NFC - NFC attendance tracking system with GUI  
**Location:** `/Users/howard/Documents/GitHub/TP_NFC/`  
**Key Files:** To read before attempting to implement improvements
- `src/gui/app.py` - Main GUI application (4200+ lines, CustomTkinter)
- `State_Structure.yaml` - Complete documentation of threading patterns and race conditions
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Overall project status and completed features
- `Improvements.yaml` - Roadmap for fixes (preserve functionality)

## Current Session Summary (Cell Editing & UI Improvements)

### ✅ Completed - Task 27: Editable Treeview Cells:

**Issue**: No ability to manually edit check-in values in the guest list.

**Fixed**: 
1. Added double-click cell editing with Entry widget overlay
2. Immediate visual feedback with checkmarks and hourglasses
3. Global click-outside-to-save functionality
4. Queue-based sync to avoid Google Sheets rate limiting
5. Consistent behavior for both typed values and manual check-in buttons

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added `on_cell_double_click()`, `start_cell_edit()`, `save_edit()`, `cancel_edit()` methods
- Added `_on_global_click()` for click-outside-to-close behavior
- Modified `on_tree_click()` to provide immediate feedback for manual check-in buttons

### ✅ Completed - Task 28: Visual Feedback System:

**Issue**: No visual indication of which guests have completed all check-ins.

**Fixed**: 
1. Green row highlighting when all stations are checked in
2. Alternate row colors (even/odd) for better readability
3. Row styling updates immediately after edits
4. Proper detection of check-ins including local queue data

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added `_is_guest_fully_checked_in()` and `_update_row_styling()` methods
- Added treeview tag configurations for "complete", "even", "odd" styling

### ✅ Completed - Task 29: Google Sheets Connection Status:

**Issue**: Sync status label only showed pending counts, not connection health.

**Fixed**: 
1. Changed sync status label to show Google Sheets connection status
2. Added status constants for consistency
3. Real-time detection of connection issues, rate limiting, etc.
4. Cell hourglasses now provide pending feedback instead of status label

**Status Messages**: 
- "✓ Google Sheets" (connected)
- "⚠️ Rate Limited" (API quota exceeded)
- "✗ No Internet" (network issues)
- "✗ Sheets Offline" (service unavailable)

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added `SYNC_STATUS_*` constants (lines 42-48)
- Added `_update_sheets_connection_status()` method
- Modified refresh functions to use connection status instead of pending counts

### ✅ Completed - Task 30: Performance & Rate Limiting:

**Issue**: Manual edits caused Google Sheets API rate limiting when used rapidly.

**Fixed**: 
1. Restored queue system for manual edits to prevent rate limiting
2. Immediate UI feedback with hourglasses while background sync occurs
3. Optimized to avoid redundant FocusOut handlers causing double saves
4. Background threading for all Google Sheets operations

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Modified `save_edit()` to use queue system instead of direct API calls
- Removed redundant FocusOut event handler
- Added background threading for manual check-in operations

### ✅ Completed - Task 31: UI Layout & Summary Row Improvements:

**Issues**: 
1. Sync status indicator was in wrong location 
2. Summary row scrolled away with guest list
3. Summary row used different font than main content
4. White outline borders around treeviews

**Fixed**:
1. **Sync Status Positioning**: Moved from search area to header, positioned left of settings hamburger menu
2. **Fixed Summary Row**: Created separate non-scrollable treeview that stays visible when scrolling
3. **Font Consistency**: Changed summary row to use same font as main tree (`TkFixedFont, 12, bold`)
4. **Border Removal**: Used `style.layout()` and focus styling to eliminate white outlines

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Moved `sync_status_label` from `search_frame` to `header_frame`
- Created dual treeview system: `summary_tree` (fixed) + `guest_tree` (scrollable)
- Updated `_add_summary_row()` and `_update_summary_row_immediate()` for fixed summary
- Modified `_sort_by_lastname()` to work without summary row in main tree
- Added `style.layout("Treeview", [('Treeview.treearea', {'sticky': 'nswe'})])` for border removal

### ✅ Completed - Task 32: Internet Connection Monitoring & Auto-Clear:

**Issues**: 
1. No real-time internet connectivity detection
2. Refresh attempts worked even when offline (cached data)
3. Status indicator didn't reflect actual network state
4. Guest ID field stayed filled indefinitely

**Fixed**:
1. **Real-time Internet Detection**: Lightweight background monitoring detects outages within 10 seconds
2. **Refresh Blocking**: Prevents refresh attempts when offline with clear error message
3. **Auto Status Updates**: Sync indicator changes from "◉" to "✗ No Internet" automatically  
4. **15-Second Auto-Clear**: Guest ID field automatically clears after 15 seconds when filled
5. **Performance Optimized**: Monitoring starts after app load, uses minimal resources

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added `_check_internet_connection()` with HTTP connectivity test
- Added `_check_internet_periodically()` for lightweight background monitoring  
- Added `_start_id_clear_timer()` and `_auto_clear_id_field()` for auto-clear functionality
- Enhanced refresh method to block when offline
- Fixed double-click issue with first row (removed outdated summary row check)

### Key Features Added:
- **Editable Cells**: Double-click any check-in cell to edit timestamp or clear
- **Immediate Feedback**: Hourglasses show pending syncs, disappear when complete
- **Visual Completion**: Green rows highlight guests with all stations checked in
- **Real-time Connection Monitoring**: Sync status (◉/✗) reflects actual internet connectivity
- **Rate Limit Protection**: Queue system prevents API quota exhaustion
- **Fixed Summary Row**: "Checked in / total" counts stay visible when scrolling
- **Auto-Clear Guest ID**: 15-second timeout prevents accidental registrations
- **Offline Protection**: Blocks futile operations when internet unavailable
- **Clean UI**: Removed all treeview borders for seamless appearance
- **Consistent UX**: All check-in methods (NFC, manual button, cell edit) behave identically
