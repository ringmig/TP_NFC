## Previous Session Summary

### NFC Connection Monitoring Fix:

**Issue Fixed**: NFC reader disconnection was spamming ERROR logs every 100ms.

### ✅ Completed:
1. **NFC Connection Monitoring**:
   - Added `_nfc_connected`, `_nfc_connection_error_logged`, `_check_nfc_connection_timer` flags
   - Implemented `start_nfc_connection_monitoring()` and `check_nfc_connection()` 
   - Checks connection every 2s (connected) or 5s (disconnected)
   - Shows "NFC reader not connected - please connect reader" in status bar
   - Auto-resumes appropriate scanning mode on reconnection

2. **Updated All Scanning Loops**:
   - Added NFC connection check at start of: `_rewrite_scan_loop()`, `_registration_scan_loop()`, `_checkpoint_scan_loop()`
   - Prevents read attempts when disconnected (stops spam)

3. **Added Connection Guards to Manual Operations**:
   - `write_to_band()`: Shows error if NFC not connected
   - `erase_tag_settings()`: ✅ Added NFC connection check 
   - `tag_info()`: ✅ Added NFC connection check
   - `rewrite_tag()`: Added NFC connection check

### ✅ CRITICAL - NOW COMPLETE:
1. **`rewrite_to_band()` method** - Verified it exists (line 2925)
2. **Methods verified to exist**:
   - `cancel_any_rewrite_operations()` - exists (line 2913)
   - `exit_rewrite_mode()` - exists (line 2892)

### Next Steps:
1. Continue with Improvements.yaml Priority 2-4 race condition fixes

### Code Modified:
- `src/gui/app.py`: Added NFC monitoring, updated scanning loops (partial)

## Current Session Summary

### ✅ Completed - Task 1: NFC Status Bar Messages:

**Issue**: No persistent visual indication when NFC reader disconnected.

**Fixed**: 
1. Added persistent red error message "NFC reader not connected - please connect reader" using `auto_clear=False`
2. Added temporary (2s) green success message "NFC reader connected" when reader connects
3. Added initial connection check on startup to show error if disconnected

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `check_nfc_connection()` method (lines 153-181) - Added auto_clear parameter
- Startup initialization (lines 115-118) - Added initial status check

### ✅ Completed - Task 2: Window Minimum Size:

**Fixed**: Changed minimum app window size from 500x400 to 800x800

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Line 87: `self.minsize(800, 800)`

### ✅ Completed - Task 3: Station Button Behavior:

**Issue**: Pressing current station button had no effect in settings mode.

**Fixed**: Modified `on_station_button_click()` to:
1. Do nothing when clicking current station (normal behavior)
2. Close settings when clicking current station while in settings mode

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `on_station_button_click()` method (lines 2429-2437) - Added special case for settings mode

### ✅ Completed - Task 4: Fix Copyright Text Visibility:

**Issue**: Copyright text was appearing outside of settings mode due to inconsistent state management.

**Fixed**: 
1. Removed redundant `copyright_label.place_forget()` calls from `close_tag_info()` and `rewrite_tag()` methods
2. Centralized copyright visibility control in `update_mode_content()` method
3. Copyright now only shows when `settings_visible = True`

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `update_mode_content()` method (lines 1012-1016) - Added centralized copyright visibility control
- `close_tag_info()` method (line 783) - Removed redundant place_forget()
- `rewrite_tag()` method (line 2418) - Removed redundant place_forget()
- `toggle_settings()` method (lines 966, 974) - Removed redundant copyright handling

### ✅ Completed - Critical Race Condition Fix:

**Issue**: Tag Info/Erase operations could start while background checkpoint scanning was active, causing concurrent NFC operations.

**Fixed**: Set `_nfc_operation_lock` immediately after checking it in `tag_info()` method to prevent race condition window.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `tag_info()` method (lines 1960-1976) - Moved lock acquisition to prevent race condition
- Added lock release in error path when operation_in_progress is true

### ✅ Completed - Multiple Critical Race Condition Fixes:

**Issue 1: Checkpoint Processing Race Condition**
- Checkpoint processing allowed station transitions mid-operation without blocking

**Fixed**: Set `operation_in_progress = True` early in check-in processing to block station transitions during tag processing.

**Issue 2: Manual Check-in Concurrency**  
- Verified already properly protected with `operation_in_progress`

**Issue 3: Rewrite Background vs. Button Conflict**
- `rewrite_to_band()` didn't set `_nfc_operation_lock`, allowing potential conflicts with background scanning

**Fixed**: Added `_nfc_operation_lock` to rewrite operations and ensured proper release in all paths.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `_scan_for_checkin()` method (lines 1639-1679) - Added early operation_in_progress protection
- `_checkin_complete()` method (lines 1747-1749) - Updated to handle pre-set operation lock
- `rewrite_to_band()` method (lines 2954-2955) - Added _nfc_operation_lock

- `_release_rewrite_lock()` method (lines 3237-3238) - Added lock release

### ✅ Completed - Task 5: Fix Persistent NFC Status Issues:

**Issue**: NFC disconnected message wasn't persistent - auto-clear logic was overriding it with "Ready to register".

**Fixed**: 
1. Modified `_auto_clear_status()` to prioritize NFC disconnection status
2. Updated `get_ready_status_message()` to check NFC connection first
3. Created helper methods to use correct status type ("error" vs "normal")
4. Fixed registration mode to only show NFC errors, hide other messages
5. Fixed brief white "Ready" text when opening settings

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `_auto_clear_status()` method (lines 3388-3390) - Added NFC disconnection priority
- `get_ready_status_message()` method (lines 208-214) - Added NFC connection check
- `_update_status_with_correct_type()` method (lines 120-126) - Helper for correct status type

- `toggle_settings()` method (lines 996-999) - Check NFC before showing ready message

### ✅ Completed - Task 6: Make Status Bar Bold:

**Fixed**: Added `weight="bold"` to status font definition for better visibility.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `setup_styles()` method (line 411) - Made status font bold

### ✅ Completed - Task 7: Global Error Message Constants:

**Issue**: Error messages like "Network error", "Please enter a guest ID", and "Invalid ID format" were hardcoded in multiple locations.

**Fixed**: 
1. Added global constants for all common error messages (lines 36-39)
2. Replaced all hardcoded instances with their respective constants:
   - 3 instances of "Network error - check connection" → `STATUS_NETWORK_ERROR`
   - 2 instances of "Please enter a guest ID" → `STATUS_PLEASE_ENTER_GUEST_ID`
   - 2 instances of "Invalid ID format" → `STATUS_INVALID_ID_FORMAT`

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added constants: `STATUS_NETWORK_ERROR`, `STATUS_PLEASE_ENTER_GUEST_ID`, `STATUS_INVALID_ID_FORMAT` (lines 37-39)
- Replaced 7 hardcoded error message instances across methods: `_process_tag_registration()`, `_scan_for_checkin()`, `tag_info()`, `write_to_band()`, `rewrite_to_band()`

### ✅ Completed - Task 8: Treeview Hover Text Color Fix:

**Issue**: Treeview hover state showed orange background but white text, making it hard to read.

**Fixed**: Changed `checkin_hover` tag configuration from `foreground="white"` to `foreground="black"` for better contrast with orange background.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Updated all 3 instances of `checkin_hover` tag_configure (lines 716, 2702, 2819)

- `create_registration_content()` method (lines 661-662) - Changed `anchor="w"` to `anchor="center"` for station column headers and data

### ✅ Completed - Task 10: Hide Registration UI When NFC Reader Disconnected:

**Issue**: Registration UI elements remained visible when NFC reader was disconnected, allowing confusing user interactions.

**Fixed**: 
1. Modified `create_registration_content()` to conditionally show UI elements only when NFC connected
2. Added automatic UI rebuild when NFC connection status changes
3. When disconnected: Hides instruction text, Guest ID input field, and Write Tag button
4. When connected: Shows full registration UI and auto-focuses input field

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `create_registration_content()` method (lines 1135-1198) - Conditional UI creation based on `_nfc_connected`
- `check_nfc_connection()` method (lines 205-206, 219-220) - Added `update_mode_content()` calls for registration mode
- Widget placeholder handling (lines 1196-1198) - Set widgets to None when not created

### ✅ Completed - Task 11: Reception Station Mode Changes:

**Issue**: Reception had registration/checkpoint mode toggle which was confusing.

**Fixed**: 
1. Removed registration/checkpoint mode toggle button for Reception station
2. Reception now always has both registration UI visible AND checkpoint scanning active in background
3. Checkpoint scanning automatically pauses during write tag operations
4. Manual Check-in button moved to status bar area for better layout

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Removed `reception_mode_btn` and `toggle_reception_mode()` method
- Set `is_checkpoint_mode = True` by default for Reception (line 56)
- Updated mode creation logic to show registration UI with background checkpoint scanning

### ✅ Completed - Task 12: NFC Reader Detection on macOS:

**Issue**: NFC reader hot-plug detection wasn't working on macOS.

**Fixed**: 
1. Added `check_connection()` method to `PyscardNFCService` that calls `readers()` each time
2. Updated `UnifiedNFCService` to use real-time connection checking

2. Delayed NFC monitoring start until after UI is fully initialized
3. Only start monitoring after guest data is loaded

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added `_initial_ui_setup` flag and proper initialization sequence

### ✅ Completed - Task 15: Registration UI Initial Display Fix:

**Issue**: Registration UI wasn't showing initially even when NFC reader was connected.

**Fixed**: Modified `create_registration_content()` to check `_initial_ui_setup` flag during startup.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `create_registration_content()` method - Added initial setup flag check

### ✅ Completed - Task 16: UI Layout Improvements:

**Issue**: Empty frame gaps and poor button placement after mode button removal.

2. Removed empty action button frames
3. Compacted layout between status bar and search frame

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Reorganized button layout and removed empty frames

### ✅ Completed - Task 17: Reception Check-in Fix:

**Issue**: Check-ins weren't working at Reception station due to mode logic conflicts.

**Fixed**: Set `is_checkpoint_mode = True` by default for Reception to enable check-in functionality.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Set default checkpoint mode for Reception (line 56)

### ✅ Completed - Task 18: Duplicate Tag Detection for Write Operations:

**Issue**: Write tag operations could overwrite existing registered tags without warning.

**Fixed**: 
1. Added global constant `STATUS_TAG_ALREADY_REGISTERED` for duplicate tag messages
2. Modified write operation to read tag first and check if already registered
3. Shows error message if tag is registered to different guest
4. Uses existing tag registration method to avoid double NFC reads

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- Added `STATUS_TAG_ALREADY_REGISTERED` constant (line 42)
- Modified `_write_to_band_thread()` to check for existing registrations
- Added `register_tag_to_guest_with_existing_tag()` method in TagManager

### ✅ Completed - Task 19: Double NFC Operation Fix:

**Issue**: During write tag operations, both write process and checkpoint scanning were trying to read tags simultaneously, causing conflicts and timeout errors.

**Fixed**: 
1. Added NFC operation lock check in `_scan_for_checkin()` before reading tags
2. Added lock verification in `_write_to_band_thread()` 
3. Proper flag management to prevent race conditions

3. 0.5s delay between retry attempts
4. Better error logging and recovery

**Files Modified**: `src/services/pyscard_nfc_service.py`
- `read_tag()` method - Added retry logic and specific error handling for unresponsive cards

### ✅ Completed - Task 21: Check-in Message Cleanup:

**Issue**: Double success messages showing on check-in (both main window and status bar).

**Fixed**: Changed status bar message from detailed check-in info to simple "Tag detected" while keeping main window message.

**Files Modified**: `src/gui/app.py`
- `_checkin_complete()` method (line 1856) - Changed status message to "Tag detected"

### ✅ Completed - Task 22: Tag Registry Logging Improvement:

**Issue**: Tag registry details were cluttering console log with mapping details.

**Fixed**: 
1. Moved detailed tag mappings to DEBUG level (file log only)
2. Added summary INFO message for console showing count only
3. Full details still saved to `logs/TP_NFC.log` file

**Files Modified**: `src/services/tag_manager.py`
- `load_registry()` method (lines 57-59) - Split logging into debug (details) and info (summary)
