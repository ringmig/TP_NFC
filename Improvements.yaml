# TP_NFC Remaining Improvements

critical_requirement:
  header: "CRITICAL REQUIREMENT"
  description: |
    All improvements must preserve existing functionality completely.
    Read entire codebase before implementing any changes.
  constraints:
    - Current NFC scanning loops and timing is already optimized
    - All UI modes and transitions must continue working
    - Thread synchronization patterns must be preserved
    - No breaking changes to user workflow or interface

status_completed_improvements:
  header: "âœ… Major Stability Work Complete"
  completed_items:
    - NFC connection monitoring and error handling
    - Race condition fixes for concurrent operations  
    - File integrity monitoring and backup systems
    - Double NFC operation conflict resolution
    - User-friendly error messages and recovery
    - Tag registry backup and recovery system

  header: "Remaining Improvements"
  
  ui_event_logging:
    priority: "Medium"
    description: "Add INFO level logging for UI events to help with debugging and usage tracking"
    events_to_log:
      - "Button clicks (Write Tag, Erase Tag, Manual Check-in)"
      - "Station switches with user context"
      - "Settings panel open/close"
      - "Search operations and filters applied"
      - "Mode toggles (registration/checkpoint)"
      - "UI error states and recoveries"
    benefits:
      - "Better troubleshooting of user workflow issues"
      - "Usage pattern analysis for future improvements"
      - "Audit trail for administrative actions"
    implementation_note: "Add strategic self.logger.info() calls at key UI interaction points"

conclusion:
  header: "Project Status"
  current_state: "The application is now highly stable and robust with comprehensive error handling, file integrity monitoring, and race condition fixes."
  
  recommendation: "Focus on user-reported issues and feature requests rather than speculative optimizations. The core stability work is complete."
  
  next_steps:
    - "Monitor application in production use"
    - "Address specific user feedback and bug reports"
    - "Consider quality-of-life improvements only if users request them"
    - "Document any complex workflows for future maintenance"
